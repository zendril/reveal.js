				<!-- 
					Interactive Part:
						- About to construct a presentation together.
						- What does every good presentation need?
							- Title Slide
						- What is the most important slide?
							- Introductions. About the speaker, clearly!
						- When trying to explain a (potentially complex topic) I prefer to tell a narrative. Bring the user along for the story.
						- We need an intro, how about "There I was .."
						- Every good story has a bit of drama, the plot.. So we need something to represent that. I'll plug in this image later
						- Now that we have a problem we need to educate the user on "Why"
							- and show how we came to our conclusions
						- Always good to show the conclusions you came to

						- sneak in the part about their papers and the closing "how I can to writing this paper now"

						TODO: finish up how i'll get info from the audience

						number the images so people won't know what they are until they show up in the final presentation.

						TODO: load the learnings from another place (so they don't see the output and give it away)

						TODO: Start with "intentionally blank" and after, start engaging the audience to get their help.
